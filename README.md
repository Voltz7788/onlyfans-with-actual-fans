# Onlyfans but with actual fans

## Introduction üéâ

This project is a full-stack website that allows users to create accounts and subscribe to creators so they can access photos and videos of fans (the type you would use to cool yourself down on a hot summers day ‚òÄÔ∏è).

As you can probably already tell, this website is a parody of the popular adult site Onlyfans. I wanted to make something that would require the use of a payment processor, such as Stripe. After brainstorming for a while, I came up with this idea and ultimately decided to go along with it because I thought it was funny (this is how I make many of my decisions in life ü§°).

## Requirements

Users should be able to:

- create an account (with credentials or OAuth)
- subscribe to their favourite creators
- pay for their subscriptions (via Stripe)
- view the posts of creators they are subscribed to
- like and comment on posts
- create, read, update and delete their own posts (CRUD)
- chat with creators\*

\* For the chat function to work, I would need users actually using my site. Since I doubt this idea will attract a large enough user base for chat to actually happen, I'll create some demo accounts that are integerated with OpenAI's Chat-GPT model to simulate a conversation with a user.
