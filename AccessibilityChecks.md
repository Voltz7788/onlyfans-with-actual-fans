Visual Accessibility:

- Color Blindness (Use "Let's get color blind" extension in Chrome)
- Blur (add filter: blur to HTML element in Chrome to see if hierarchy is still clear)
- Grayscale (add filter: grayscale to HTML element in Chrome to see if hierarchy is still clear)
- Clear focus styling
- Good contrast (check this on build?)
